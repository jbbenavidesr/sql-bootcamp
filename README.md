# The Complete SQL Bootcamp: Go from Zero to Hero

Code exercises and challenges developed as I go through [this course in udemy.](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-sql-bootcamp)

## Database

For running the database used for the course I set up a docker compose to spin un a postgres server locally.

## Challenges

In general throughout the course all challenges will be working with a dvd rental
database. The idea is to put myself in the role of a DBA hired by this dvd rental
store and answer questions using the database.
